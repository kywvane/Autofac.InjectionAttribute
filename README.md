## Reading the Examples
The examples in the repo are always for the latest Autofac versions and libraries. Look at the tags on this repo to see examples for older and/or deprecated functionality.

The examples attempt to stick pretty close to the [Autofac documentation](https://autofac.readthedocs.io) so it helps to have that available.

## Building the Examples
The `Examples.sln` file has all the samples in it _except_ the ServiceFabric example. ServiceFabric is in a child directory and has its own solution.
